# What is this?
This is an unofficial git repository for people who write [JSST2025](https://jsst-conf.jp/2025/) proceedings in latex. The official latex template is slightly modified.
There is no technical support for this modified latex source.

# How to compile
If you have installed texlive in your environment, you can compile it with the `latexmk` command.

```bash
latexmk samplepaper.tex
```

# Use with Overleaf
This source file is **not** published as an Overleaf template.
However, as far as I know the Overleaf template in this [link](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-conference-proceedings-template-updated-2022-01-12/wcvbtmwtykqj) would be the most similar to JSST2025 proceedings.
Of course, any problems that arise from the use of this Overleaf template are the responsibility of the author(s) of the paper.
